# Agentic-AI-Workflow-using-Team-based-LLM-system-with-Autogen-Research


# Project Caption:
Autogen-centric collaborative agent system for unsupervised task operation with Knowledge aggregation

# Project Foundations:
Make an end-to-end pipeline with Autogen including Agentic Chat The keys parts are:
•	Use open-source platform to make agentic AI system
•	System working as self-operating task with self-directed agents for programmatic coding, troubleshooting code, LLM supported summarization, report generation, and adaptive reasoning powered by dialogue
Google Colab notebook includes: a network of agents, role specialization for each agent, and collaborative messaging among agents to gate key results.

# Primary Tools and Frameworks:
•	Python programming language
•	Autogen (AI agents pipeline)
•	OpenAI gpt model (LLMs) 
•	Google Colab notebook
•	Parallel-agent self-managed

# Project Intent:
Before starting this project, I made a list of goals:
•	Make a Machine-controlled Agentic-system using Autogen (Agentic AI). How ??
•	Framework design for collaborative LLM agent system
•	Facilitate agent-to-agent interaction without human guidance
•	Apply programmatic research and Knowledge synthesis workflows.

# Significant Points:
•	Install all necessary items associated with Autogen used for Agentic chat
•	Defines parameter management JSON used for LLM settings
•	Run a network of self-governing agents (UserProxyAgent, AssistantAgent,  GroupChat and GroupChatManager)

# Key Takeaways:
AI agents show self-managed teamwork with the Autogen architecture. It presents a repeatable architecture for: LLM agent collaboration, research involved in AI, coordinated agent problem solving with input processing
